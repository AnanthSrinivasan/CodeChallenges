This Algorithm has to be called everytime when we navigate through the navigation
sequence. we have to pass the input as given below and get the best possible way
to navigate from the given low channel no. to the high channel no.

Input

	1. lowest and highest channel that is viewable
	2. blocked channels array
	3. source
	4. target

Compute steps required to move from source to target through,

Lets compute for the case where source is less than target

1. UP Button
	steps = (target - source) - (blockedChannels between target and source)

2. Down Button
	steps = (Highest - Lowest) - (target - source) - 
			(blockedChannels outside the target and source range) + 1
 
3. Number Buttons
	steps = No. of digits present in the channel

Best way to reach from source to target can be computed as follows,

minNavigationSteps = minSteps(up, down, number)
bestNavigationAction = action through which bestNavigationSteps is obtained.

We have to handle the below conditions and change/reverse the above computations

1. source == target
2. source < target
3. source > target
