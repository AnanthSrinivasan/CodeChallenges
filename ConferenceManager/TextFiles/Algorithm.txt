Algorithm:

1. Read the input and keep it in hash, lets call it talks_hash
2. Create the session object 
3. Pick up the talks from talks_hash and fill in the session object
4. Session object has to be filled based on the type.
5. Create the track object
6. Add the filled session object to the track
7. After All the talks are added to tracks, we are done. 
8. Output the filled tracks in the response.
