Algorithm:

1. Read the input and keep it in hash, lets call it talks_hash
2. Also lets divide the session inputs and keep it as sessions information
3. Organizer splits the tracks as per the talks duration per day
4. Hand off these information to Track Manager 
5. Track Manager arranges the talks as per the session info
6. Give back the arranged track info to the Organizer.
7. Repeat 4 - 6 till we are done with all the talks.
